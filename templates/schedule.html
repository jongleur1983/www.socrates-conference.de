        <p>
            To get an impression of what you can expect, have a look at last year's schedule for
            <a href="/static/socrates_2013_collection/large-12.html">Friday</a> and
            <a href="/static/socrates_2013_collection/large-13.html">Saturday</a>.
            You can see that the range of topics is quite diverse, as is the kind of session (discussion, hands-on
            coding, ...).<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: <strong>you</strong> set the agenda. This is your time, make
            the best of it!
            For ideas about what you an do in advance have a look at <a
                href="http://www.unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/"
                target="_blank">unconference.net</a>.</p>

        <p>
            Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

        <h2>Evening activities</h2>

        <p>
            In the previous years there were a multitude of things going on in
            the evenings, from music (some participants brought instruments,
            songbooks etc., one year they even wrote a song about the
            conference) over board games to
            <a href="https://github.com/janernsting/maexchen">live-hacking programs to play mia against each other</a>.
            And of course there's always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.

                <strong>Open Space Technology (OST)</strong> is an approach for hosting meetings,
                conferences, corporate-style retreats and community summit events, focused on a specific
                and important purpose or task—but beginning without any formal agenda, beyond the overall
                purpose or theme.
