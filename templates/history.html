            Starting in 2011, the first &ldquo;Software Craftsmanship and
            Testing (un)conference&rdquo; took place in Germany. Since then, the
            community and therefore the event grew larger.

            which sums up some details why and how SoCraTes was established. He graciously allowed
            us to quote the following parts of it:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://twitter.com/leiderleider">Andreas Leidig</a>
                and <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole Rauch</a>
                started the whole thing way back in late 2010. They wanted to
                get a discussion going regarding a conference on Software
                Craftsmanship in Germany. We decided to meet up during <a
                    href="http://www.xpdays.de">XP Days Germany</a> in 2010, and
                see what we could do. We quickly agreed on an unconference
                format, two days, somewhere laid back. Some folks had organized
                the German Agile Coach Camp and <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/Play4Agile">Play4Agile</a> in
                Rückersbach close to Frankfurt. We decided on that spot as well,
                and organized everything for 2011. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Early on, we figured that we will need outside support. That was
                when we started to reach out to other craftsmen, like <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/slagyr">Micah Martin</a>, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye">Adewale
                    Oshineye</a>, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/SandroMancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a>,
                and many, many more. We had around 10-20 participants from
                outside Germany with us at the first SoCraTes. All the tales
                they told us on how they were running things in London, Israel,
                Finland, you-name-it engaged us. It felt good to be around so
                many like-minded folks, and receive outside inspiration.
            </p>

            <h3>First year - 2011</h3>
            <p>
                The first <a href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes
                    - Software Craftsmanship and Testing (un)conference</a> -
                was a success. We had some track sessions back then, and a full
                day of Open Space. During the Open Space I joined a session that
                took a look on how to continue. With all the energy in the
                place, we put ourselves on a virtual map of Germany. That was
                when I noticed, oh, there are a bunch of other folks around me
                that come from a similar location as I do. That was also when we
                decided that we needed to keep that spirit going. We talked to
                folks in our neighborhood, and found soon some company for local
                user groups to keep on spreading the word.
            </p>

            <h3>Second year - 2012</h3>
            <p>
                One year later, we came back for SoCraTes 2012. Since the first
                conference we had established 10 user groups all over Germany on
                Software Craftsmanship, all organized under the banner of <a
                    href="http://softwerkskammer.org">Softwerkskammer</a>. There
                was one in Hamburg, one in Karlsruhe, one in Munich, one in
                Nürnberg, one in Berlin, one in Frankfurt, one in Dortmund, one
                in Düsseldorf, and one shared around Münster, Osnabrück, and
                Bielefeld. We created a timeline of events that had happened in
                the various local communities since our first get-together.
            </p>

            <p>
                We were amazed about the various events, code retreats, user
                group meetings, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                We still adhered to reserve space for foreign inspirations at
                that time. We had 10-20 people from outside Germany with us.
                However, Rückersbach had just 70 beds overall available. With
                ten local user groups potentially joining our unconference, we
                faced a serious problem. From each location just around 5 people
                would be able to join. So, with such a large community, we
                already excluded many potential attendees.
            </p>

            <p>
                The format of the conference had shifted though. We had
                abandoned previously-set track sessions all-together. Instead we
                focused on two full days of Open Space. That provided the
                freedom necessary. In the end, we decided to run the conference
                again in Rückersbach, but have it organized by a different group
                of people. We explicitly decided to pass over the organizing
                responsibility to one of the local groups from year to year.
            </p>

            <h3>Third year - 2013</h3>
            <p>
            In 2013, the limited amount of beds became a problem. We discussed
            again what to do about it, and asked the organizers to seek a
            location that may scale up to 200 participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Moving on - 2014</h3>
            <p>
                Rückersbach had an advantage: it was close to Frankfurt airport
                (about a one hour ride by car). That made it easy for people
                from other countries to attend, since Frankfurt is the largest
                airport in Germany. It would be hard to find such a spot with
                more beds in such a good position.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="{% url 'location' %}">spot we found</a>, looks
                promising according to the folks that have been there to inspect
                the place. The spot has 200 beds (with close-by hotels for
                expansion), and is located in Soltau. That's about a one hour
                ride by car outside from Hamburg. There are ten meeting rooms
                all set up with video projectors, flipcharts, and so on, one
                central place where everyone meets, one large room for the Open
                Space opening, a bar with space for 170 people in the evening, a
                swimming pool, decent space outside close to nature. We are
                convinced that this is a fitting place to scale SoCraTes to a 
                larger audience.
