        <p>
            To get an impression of what you can expect, have a look at last year's schedule for
            <a href="/static/socrates_2013_collection/large-12.html">Friday</a> and
            <a href="/static/socrates_2013_collection/large-13.html">Saturday</a>.
            You can see that the range of topics is quite diverse, as is the kind of session (discussion, hands-on coding, ...).<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: <strong>you</strong> set the agenda. This is your time, make the best of it!
            For ideas about what you an do in advance have a look at <a
                href="http://www.unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/"
                target="_blank">unconference.net</a>.
            You can also read some experience reports from last year:

            about the <a href="http://www.shino.de/2014/03/03/socrates-2014/">history of SoCraTes</a> by Markus Gärtner.

        <p>
            Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

        <h4>Evening activities</h4>

        <p>
            In the previous years there were a multitude of things going on in
            the evenings, from music (some participants brought instruments,
            songbooks etc., one year they even wrote a song about the
            conference) over board games to
            <a href="https://github.com/janernsting/maexchen">live-hacking programs to play mia against each other</a>.
            And of course there's always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.

                <strong>Open Space Technology (OST)</strong> is an approach for hosting meetings,
                conferences, corporate-style retreats and community summit events, focused on a specific
                and important purpose or task—but beginning without any formal agenda, beyond the overall
                purpose or theme.

        <h4>Rooms</h4>

        <p>
            Some of the facility's rooms are twin rooms. An important aspect of
            SoCraTes is its closedness where everything happens in the same location. Therefore, we can
            only accept as many participants as there are beds available.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you register, you can let us know whom you'd be willing to share a room with. Even if
            you don't know anybody just yet, we will do all we can to find a suitable roommate for you.
            After registration there will also be a wiki for participants to get to know each other and
            arrange things.
        </p>

        <h4>Location</h4>

        <p>
            Out in the country, at the lovely Hotelpark Soltau
            (<a href="http://www.hotel-park-soltau.de/">German only website</a>),
            approximately one hour from Hamburg.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/mpcC0">Winsener Straße 111, 29614 Soltau, Germany </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            It offers great facilities for community-centered events with included accommodation. We
            have rented the whole facility, so we can concentrate on what we like to do most.
