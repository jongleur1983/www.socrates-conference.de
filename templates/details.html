      <p>
        The event will be run as a two day Open Space, facilitated by <a
        href="http://blog.connexxo.com/" target="_blank">Pierluigi Pugliese</a>, a highly skilled
        facilitator.
      </p>
      <p>
        After last year's feedback we decided to do without any set sessions and focus on the power
        of the participants. You can get further impressions of an Open Space <a
        href="http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get an impression of what you will expect and especially what <em>you</em> can do in
        advance have a look at: <a

      <p>
        Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

      <h4>
        Main Event
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>August 1-3 2013</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The SoCraTes conference will take place from the evening of Thursday August 1st 2013 (about
        5pm) through the evening on Saturday August 3rd 2013. So we will have 48 hours to
        collaborate and share.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Additional Code Retreat
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>August 4 2013</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The main event will be followed by a <a href="http://coderetreat.org/" target="_blank">Code
        Retreat</a> on Sunday (until about 6pm). This will be a <strong>separate, optional</strong>
        event which is not included in the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important note:</strong> Participation in the code retreat will cause additional accommodation costs!

        <p>
          <strong>Open Space Technology (OST)</strong> is an approach for hosting meetings,
          conferences, corporate-style retreats and community summit events, focused on a specific
          and important purpose or task—but beginning without any formal agenda, beyond the overall
          purpose or theme.

      <h3>Housekeeping</h3>
      <h4>Rooms</h4>
      <p>
        The facility offers about 50 rooms, most of which are twin rooms. An important aspect of
        SoCraTes is its closedness where everything happens in the same location. Therefore, we can
        only accept as many participants as there are beds available. When all of the single bed
        rooms are taken, everybody who requests a single room will transform one of the twin rooms
        into a single bed room, reducing the number of available slots by one. <strong>Therefore we
        strongly encourage that you choose the "shared room" option during registration</strong>.
        And, once you come to think about it, there are very few reasons to spend much time in your
        room apart from sleeping and the occasional shower -- which, thanks to the Open Space
        format, you can take whenever it is the right time for you to do so ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        When you register, you can let us know whom you'd be willing to share a room with. Even if
        you don't know anybody just yet, we will do all we can to find a suitable roommate for you.
        After registration there will also be a wiki for participants to get to know each other and
        arrange things.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Money
      </h4>
      <p>
        Thanks to our generous sponsors we'll be able to keep the costs down. These are the targeted
        fees for the main event (including everything except the evening drinks at the bar):
      </p>
      <p>
        The total price for the conference participation, two overnight stays, meals and coffee will
        not exceed 250 Euros. The exact amount depends on the number of sponsors we will be able to
        attract. If we find enough sponsors the conference will cost less than 200.- Euros.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year the participants only had to pay the accommodation for two nights including
        breakfast and dinner. These fees are about 65 € per night for a shared room and 86 € per
        night for a single room.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>
        Out in the country, at the lovely Seminarzentrum Rückersbach (<a
        href="http://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/" title="Herzlich Willkommen im SeminarZentrum
        Rückersbach" target="_blank">German only website</a>), one hour from Frankfurt (Main)
        airport.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://maps.google.de/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=200871005776196874621.0004bae59888624a30481&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=50.015876,8.857491&amp;spn=0.070623,0.572534&amp;source=embed" target="_blank">Kolpingstraße 1, 63867 Johannesberg, Germany</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It offers great facilities for community-centered events with included accommodation. We
        have rented the whole facility, so we can concentrate on what we like to do most.
      </p>
