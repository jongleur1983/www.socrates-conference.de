    <h1>Code of Conduct <span class="text-muted">for SoCraTes 2014.</span></h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">
    All participants, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are
    required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
    enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from
    all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>
<p class="lead">
    Contact us at <a
        href="mailto:info@socrates-conference.de">info@socrates-conference.de</a>
    with any questions or concerns you might have.
</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>
<p class="lead">
    Our conference is dedicated to providing a safe and enjoyable conference
    experience for everyone.
</p>
<p> 
    That is, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, or religion the conference wants to be a safe
    environment for everybody. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
    participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for
    any conference venue, including but not limited to workshops, sessions,
    Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these
    rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <strong>without a
    refund</strong> at the discretion of the conference organisers.
</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>
    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
    sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
    following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks
    or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
    attention.
</p>

<p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
    immediately.
</p>

<p>
    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
    sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
</p>

<p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers
    may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
    expulsion from the conference with no refund.
</p>

<p>
    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
    have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
    immediately. Conference organisers can be identified as they'll be wearing
    branded t-shirts.
</p>

<p>
    Organisers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
    security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
    those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
    conference. We value your attendance.
</p>

<p>
    We expect participants to follow these rules throughout the whole conference
    and workshop duration, and all conference-related social events and venues.
</p>
