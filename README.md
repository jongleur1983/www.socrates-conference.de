## Installation

### For development

Note: Due to naming restrictions in python modules, the name of the directory that contains the git repo should not contain the dot-character

    # create a virtualenv & activate it
    
    $> pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    
    # say no, when asked to create a superuser
    $> ./manage.py syncdb --migrate
    $> ./manage.py createsuperuser
    
    $> ./manage.py runserver


### Production Install

- Make sure the correct SITE_ID is set in settings.prod
- create a `settings/keys.py` file that contains values for the secret settings listed in 
  `settings/prod.py`
- set the environment variable "ENV_PROD" to some true value, e.g. 1
  
#### Heroku style

    $> heroku config:add ENV_PROD=1
    $> heroku config:add TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxx
    $> heroku config:add TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxx
    $> heroku config:add SECRET_KEY=xxxx
    $> heroku config:add EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=xxxx
    
    # say no, when asked to create a superuser
    $> heroku run python manage.py syncdb --migrate
    $> heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser

    $> heroku ps:scale web=1
